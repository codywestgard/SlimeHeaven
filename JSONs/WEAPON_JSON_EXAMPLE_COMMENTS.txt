## Most guns can re-use the same scenes (basic gun, basic laser)
# You can adjust the other variables and sprite to make a new gun
# some guns do need special logic (eg lasers that charge, guns that don't reload)
# too special just needs its own scene

# Final plan:
# Game loads a gun from here
# Adds a random modification (eg +10% fire rate) with rarity chance

# Final loader needs to combine gun + chip + attachment dynamically
